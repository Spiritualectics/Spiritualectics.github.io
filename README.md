## Core Models

- **Terminal Manner Doctrine (TMD)**  
  Predicts the *manner* of death based on four dominant energetic fields: Natural Force, Spiritual Force, Behavioral Will, and Predisposed End.

- **Quantifiable Energy-Aura Scale (QEAS)**  
  A scoring model that measures an individual's aura based on emotional energy, conscious intensity, behavioral resonance, and subconscious flux.

- **Quantum Imprint Hypothesis of Reincarnation (QIHR)**  
  Proposes measurable karmic memory and emotional imprints across lifetimes, modeled through energy discharge and soul continuity.

- **Dual-Stream Will Framework (DSWF)**  
  Explains the interaction of subconscious and conscious will in determining human action.

- **Spiritualectic Suicide Prediction Matrix (SSPM)**  
  Predicts terminal behavior risk through variables like Emotional Discharge, Spiritual Numbness, and Perceived Pointlessness.
